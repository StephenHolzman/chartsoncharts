People have sex.

This has been linked to later giving birth in some cases.

Behold this chart:

There are quite a few stories to be told here. Some of them are below, but first some definitions that help clarify what the chart is and is not showing.

**TLDR; Number of babies being born around the world per woman has mostly been going down! Age of moms is going up!**

Fertility rates are a measure of the number of children being born into the world, but there are a few different kinds that might cause confusion if you are not the kind of person that reads *Population and Development Review* for fun.

<h4>1. Age-Specific Fertility Rates</h4>

Age-Specific Fertility rates are relatively straight-forward and the main focus of the interactive chart above. An ASFR for a given age in a given year is the number of babies a woman that age would have birthed on average that year. ASFRs tend to be pretty small, although as a Facebook user in my mid-twenties it sometimes does not seem this way.

The overall size of the blobs indicate the total number of babies being born. The shifting peaks in the blobs show the age most women in a particular country are having babies.

<h4>2. Total Fertility Rates</h4>

This is the simple one-number statistic you are most likely to be familiar with. The Total Fertility Rate for a given year is the sum of all the ASFRs, in other words the average number of children a woman would have if the age-specific rates were held constant throughout her reproductive years assuming she survives to live them.

The total fertility rate for a given country in a given year can be viewed on the country selection table.

<h4>3. Cohort Completed Fertility</h4>

Of course, Age-Specific Fertility Rates are anything but constant. Cohort completed fertility is what actually happened for women born in a given year. It is possible for a population's total fertility rate to drop not because people are having fewer babies over the course of their lives, but because they are just delaying pregnancy until later in life.

This chart does not show cohort completed fertility or how many total babies on average are projected to be born to women still in their reproductive years.
